# Embed.me

Embed.me is my first web project build from scratch to gain hands-on experience and potfolio purposes. 

## Responsiveness 

I tried to make it responsive on the screens that are greater then 950px and less then 500px wider. In between I tried to take care of them as well but not too much focused.

## Time Consumed 

As this is my first project I learned alot while working. So I tried and completed this in week.

## Known Issues

Their are some known issue related to sizing, responsivness,  font-sizing across pages. I will improve this in future.
