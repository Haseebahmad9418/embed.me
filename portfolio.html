                            <p class="card-description">Our client approached <em><b>Embed.me</b></em> with an innovative vision: to develop a Flutter mobile application that seamlessly connects to custom-built hardware using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. The goal was to transmit and receive data between the app and hardware, enabling real-time data visualization on an oscilloscope-like graph. The client required a mobile application that could establish a BLE connection, display real-time data, save data to a file, plot saved data on-demand, show a timer display, and indicate the connection status and data receiving state. Additionally, the app needed to provide an options page for configurations and related information, as well as a device selection page for BLE connectivity.</p>

                            <p class="card-description">With a vision to enhance the drink ordering process via kiosk desktop application, our valued client entrusted Embed.me with the task. The goal was to seamlessly connect the app to a hardware device for transmitting order data. Our team of application developers diligently crafted an intuitive interface, allowing customers to effortlessly select drink type, size, flavors, and enter their name for a flawless ordering experience. <br> The resulting desktop application revolutionized drink ordering, streamlining operations and delighting customers with its seamless functionality and intuitive design.</p>

                            <h2 class="card-title">An optimal-frequency massager for a large-scale manufacturer</h2>
                            <p class="card-description">A large-scale manufacturer of massagers engaged with a team of mechanical and electrical engineers at <em><b>Embed.me</b></em> to optimize the vibration frequency for the release of the next model. The vibrations, which were previously also felt in the handle, had to be limited to just the head of the massager to achieve the desired comfort to the end-user. To enhance the utility of the massager, the client also suggested that the revamped solution should be a cordless device with an aesthetically appealing design. <br>The redesigned massager, with its improved vibration control and cordless functionality, offers unparalleled comfort and convenience, setting a new standard in relaxation technology. </p>
